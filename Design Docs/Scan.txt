The purpose of this story is for a technition to scan into a job/car, the result of this action 
will be used to start the billing for that tech for that day for that car.  The scan out action
is the closing of the time for the task and ends billing.  Notes are required to be entered by 
the tech when scanning out so we know what work was performed on the car during that period.
